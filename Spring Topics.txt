Got it! To ensure your React project works properly, especially for handling authentication, token decoding, and interacting with APIs, you'll need a few essential libraries. Based on your project, hereâ€™s a list of common libraries and modules you might need:

### 1. **JWT Decoding:**
   - **`jwt-decode`**: For decoding JWT tokens on the client side.
     ```bash
     npm install jwt-decode
     ```

### 2. **Axios:**
   - **`axios`**: For making HTTP requests (for example, to your authentication API).
     ```bash
     npm install axios
     ```

### 3. **React Router:**
   - **`react-router-dom`**: If your application uses client-side routing.
     ```bash
     npm install react-router-dom
     ```

### 4. **Context API / Redux (Optional):**
   If you're managing global state (like user authentication status), you might use React's Context API or Redux.

   - **`react`**: React itself (ensure it's installed as it's the core library).
     ```bash
     npm install react
     ```

   - **`react-dom`**: For ReactDOM functionality (typically already included in a new React project).
     ```bash
     npm install react-dom
     ```

   - **Redux (Optional)**: For state management if you're using Redux.
     ```bash
     npm install redux react-redux
     ```

### 5. **Form Handling (Optional):**
   - **`formik`**: A popular form library for easier form handling.
     ```bash
     npm install formik
     ```

   - **`yup`**: For form validation (commonly used with `formik`).
     ```bash
     npm install yup
     ```

### 6. **React Hooks (Optional):**
   - **`use-hooks`**: To help with custom hooks, if you're utilizing them.
     ```bash
     npm install use-hooks
     ```

### 7. **CSS Framework (Optional):**
   If you're using a UI framework like **Bootstrap** or **Material UI**:

   - **`bootstrap`**:
     ```bash
     npm install bootstrap
     ```

   - **`@mui/material`** (Material UI):
     ```bash
     npm install @mui/material @emotion/react @emotion/styled
     ```

   - **`react-bootstrap`** (React-specific Bootstrap components):
     ```bash
     npm install react-bootstrap
     ```

### 8. **Environment Variables:**
   If you're using environment variables (for storing API keys or sensitive info), make sure **`dotenv`** is set up for your development environment.
   ```bash
   npm install dotenv
   ```

### Summary of Essential Libraries for Your Use Case:

1. **JWT Handling**:
   - `jwt-decode`

2. **API Calls**:
   - `axios`

3. **Routing** (if applicable):
   - `react-router-dom`

4. **Global State Management** (if using Redux):
   - `redux`
   - `react-redux`

5. **Form Management** (Optional):
   - `formik`
   - `yup`

6. **UI/Styling** (Optional):
   - `bootstrap` or `@mui/material` (depending on your UI framework)

### Example Installation Commands:
```bash
npm install jwt-decode axios react-router-dom redux react-redux formik yup bootstrap
```
